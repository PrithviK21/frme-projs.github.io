## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Went with a mobile first workflow after last time's issues. Was much easier, finished much faster.  Flexbox is really cool haha. Used nth child a lot, might be a better way to target cards, coulda added classes for color, would work the same.
